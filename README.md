Aurora is an open-source C++ game engine with an emphasis on architectural quality and performance. Born out of my desire to understand how anything and everything works, it has become my go-to place for research. If you're on the lookout for knowledge, you may appreciate this as a study resource. A mature tools framework is also included as one of the main features of the engine. <br/> <br/>

More documentation to follow.
